The analysis of the video material ist based on the number of bright pixels counted in every taken picture of the slime mold. The collected data affects the dimensions of the animation in the final result. The geometric elliptical shape is based on the superformula, which was invented 1997. The purpose is the generalization all kinds of elliptical forms. The dataset transforms the ellipsis over time and thus visualizes the growth of the slime mold."
