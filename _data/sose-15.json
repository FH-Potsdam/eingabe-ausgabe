The red coulor was quite similar.It did not destroy him, but the slime mold wanted to go to an other source of food which was much far away. As you can see in the movie the only coulor was yellow (witch is actualy it`s own colour)witch was not avoided. I think it was realy interesting to work with this remarkable living thing. If i had more time for experiments like this i might have had results with more force of expression. All in all it was real fun. Thanks to Fabian Morón Zirfas for this innovative idea."

        "abstract": "The idea of my project was to surprise the viewer with the help of an illusion. For this i used the morales effekt (6 frame anmitaion) especially because it works with movement. wich is a central topic in the modern society. Everything is getting faster, more precise and effektive. The human beeing always has to work  directly like a machine  at it`s best 24 hours a day. The human is in movement everytime to follow his aims. The question is if people still have the ability to follow their realy dreams and if they run after something with never had existed."

The second idea was to build something and hide the camera, somthing like a drawing. It should be somehow mystical and creepy, like a drawing with lots of eyes, and one of them allways focusing on you."
