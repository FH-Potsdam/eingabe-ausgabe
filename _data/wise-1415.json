    "abstract": "Flags are symbolic visual systems that are often designed based on a nations history and origins and not necessarily on aesthetics. Visual as they are, they often - intended or unintended - create specific sentiments to the viewer. Being the most important visual representation of a state, I want to examine what flags are perceived especially beneficial or unfavorable for its state when viewed by others."
